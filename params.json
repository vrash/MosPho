  "body": "## MosPho\r\nBasic image mosaic creator. Also Phil Karlton apparently once said\r\n>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\r\n\r\nHence the poor name choice. The 's' wasnt there in the original title. \r\n\r\n### Implementation \r\nBare bones. As much background processing as possible. No Picasso/Fresco/Retrofit and other things. No real OOP. Does the job for an MVP though and I'd be happy to ship and measure progress before building a beast. If there's no network, I pick up average chunk colours and display the mosaic.\r\n\r\n### Logic\r\nVery Simple. \r\n* FETCH IMAGE FROM WHEREVER THE USER WANTS TO\r\n* SPLIT IMAGE INTO SMALLER PIECES\r\n* RUN EACH ROW THROUGH THE NETWORK TO FIND THE EQUIVALENT IMAGE\r\n* STITCH THE IMAGE BACK\r\n* DISPLAY MOSAIC AND VOILA, WE'RE DONE.\r\n\r\n### MinSDK\r\nKitKat - API 19. Reason is that still a large % of users are on kitkat and although tempting to set minSDK to Lollipop (and get all the Palette class goodness) this is better for bare bones coding and manipulation. \r\n\r\n### ScreenGrabs of important functionality\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@vrash\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
