  "body": "## MosPho\r\nBasic image mosaic creator. Also Phil Karlton apparently once said\r\n>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\r\n\r\nHence the poor name choice. The 's' wasn't there in the original title. \r\n\r\n### Implementation \r\nBare bones. As much background processing as possible. No Picasso/Fresco/Retrofit and other things. No real OOP. Does the job for an MVP though, can be put into a full blow app as a module to ship. If there's no network, I pick up average chunk colours and display the mosaic. Url - Bitmaps are cached in a LRU bitmap cache, so it should get faster on more use. No disk cache for now. No tests for now, but stubs can easily be put in for critical pieces and a latch based test mechanism for the async tasks. \r\nOverall core logic time taken -- About 3.5 - 4 hours. [Commit History](https://github.com/vrash/MosPho/commits/master) gives a rudimentary sense of progress\r\n\r\n\r\n### Logic\r\nVery Simple. \r\n* FETCH IMAGE FROM WHEREVER THE USER WANTS TO\r\n* SPLIT IMAGE INTO SMALLER PIECES\r\n* RUN EACH ROW THROUGH THE NETWORK TO FIND THE EQUIVALENT IMAGE (OR CACHE)\r\n* STITCH THE IMAGE BACK (TODO: ROW BY ROW STITCHING)\r\n* DISPLAY MOSAIC AND VOILA, WE'RE DONE.\r\n\r\n### MinSDK\r\nKitKat - API 19. Reason is that still a large % of users are on kitkat and although tempting to set minSDK to Lollipop (and get all the Palette class goodness) this is better for bare bones coding and manipulation. \r\n\r\n### ScreenGrab\r\n###32 X 32 (1024 dpi) \r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/942418/20457410/ef125624-aeb0-11e6-87f4-9542853403a5.png)\r\n###45 X 45 (2048 dpi)\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/942418/20460626/96d073de-af0e-11e6-9465-f9fe5f8915d7.png)\r\n###64 X 64 (4096 dpi)\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/942418/20460618/331c4ce6-af0e-11e6-8c94-75a4bbf48664.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@vrash\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
